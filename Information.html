                        <td>To ensure the smooth operation of Optimus Manager, it is essential to consider the hardware requirements that will support the application software. The following sections detail the necessary hardware components, operating system, RAM requirements, and other pertinent information.</td>
                        <td>The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, is crucial for processing the complex algorithms and data required by Optimus Manager. A multi-core processor with a minimum clock speed of 3.0 GHz is recommended. This ensures that the application can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, such as real-time robot control, data processing, and user interface management.</td>
                        <td>RAM is the quick thinker of the computer, allowing for the temporary storage and quick access of data. For Optimus Manager, a minimum of 16 GB of RAM is required. This amount of memory ensures that the application can run smoothly without lag, especially when managing multiple robots simultaneously. For optimal performance, 32 GB of RAM is recommended.</td>
                        <td>While Optimus Manager is not primarily a graphics-intensive application, a dedicated GPU can offload some of the processing tasks from the CPU, leading to better overall performance. A mid-range GPU with at least 4 GB of VRAM is sufficient for this purpose.</td>
		       <td>Optimus Manager is designed to be compatible with both Windows and macOS operating systems. For Windows, Windows 10 or later is recommended, while for macOS, macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later is preferred. These operating systems provide the necessary support for the application’s features and ensure compatibility with the latest hardware components.</td>
		       <td>Given that Optimus Manager involves real-time control and monitoring of robotic systems, a stable and high-speed internet connection is essential. A minimum internet speed of 100 Mbps is recommended to ensure seamless communication between the app and the robots.</td>
